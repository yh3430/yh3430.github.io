This website is about making some plotly examples.



```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

library(plotly)
```

Let's look at the NYC airbnb data

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb =
  nyc_airbnb %>% 
  mutate(
    stars = review_scores_location/2
  ) %>% 
  select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, stars, price, room_type, lat, long) %>% 
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group == "Manhattan",
    room_type == "Entire home/apt",
    price %in% 100:500
  ) %>% 
  drop_na(stars)
  
```

## Make a scatterplot

Here's a plotly scatterplot!

```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nStars: ", stars)) %>% 
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y = ~long, type = "scatter", mode = "markers",
    color = ~price, text = ~text_label, alpha = 0.5)
```
